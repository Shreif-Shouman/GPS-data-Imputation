# GPS Data Imputation 🌍

## Project Overview 📖
This project tackles the challenge of missing GPS data from vehicle trips within Austria 🇦🇹. Our goal is to enhance the granularity and accuracy of this real-world dataset through sophisticated imputation methods.

## Dataset Description 📊
The dataset comprises vehicle trip data stored in two Pickle files, which includes locations, times, and various other metrics. We handle missing entries that are common in real-world data scenarios, improving reliability and usability.

## Installation and Setup 🛠️
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then clone the repository and set up the environment:

## Methods for Imputation 🔍
* Location-based Imputation: Uses geographical proximity to estimate missing values.
* Temporal Interpolation: Employs time-series predictions to fill gaps.

## Visualization 🗺️
We use Folium for mapping data points geographically.
